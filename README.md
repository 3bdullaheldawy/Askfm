# Askfm
This project is my first training on concepts of object-oriented programming using c++.
This project is a simple simulation of ASKfm app, I used structs, classes, objects, functions to built it.
In this Project user can Sign up or Login,then they can press 1 to see Questions or press 2 to see Answers which i have stored in files.
Later i will add more functions that allow users to add their questions and answers by themselvies and answeres each other
